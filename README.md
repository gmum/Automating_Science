# Automating Science

The repository for the course "Automating Science" taught at the Jagiellonian University in 2024. The page is hosted by the machine learning research group GMUM.

## Theme

How Machine Learning can facilitate scientific discoveries. We will discuss how we make progress and potential role of applying AI methods into the scientific problems.

## Schedule

- lectures: Wednesdays 4pm
- tutorials: Fridays 10.15am

We highly encourage you to attend the classes and engage with your colleagues.
